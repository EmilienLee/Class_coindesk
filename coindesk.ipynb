       "  'content': '\"we look at ethereum like aol or myspace\"that\\'s how mobius network co-founder and ceo david gobaud explains why his startup ran its initial coin offering (ico) on the stellar network instead of ethereum the most popular blockchain for token salesthe comment underscores the growing interest in some corners of the crypto community for faster and cheaper payment rails as ethereum like bitcoin struggles to scalemobius announced thursday that it has raised $39 million in the ico — one of the larger recent token sales and the largest by far on the stellar platform the company accepted only stellar\\'s native currency lumens (xlm) in exchange for its own token known as mobi according to mobius the sale hit its $39 million hard cap after only two hours selling 35 percent of the total 888 million mobi tokensparticipants in the round included china\\'s angel chain capital nirvana capital and waltonchain an internet of things (iot) startup that is building devices to enable manufacturers and retailers to track supply chains according to the firm\\'s websitein addition to this backing gobaud emphasized that mobius deployed its decentralized app (dapp) store alongside its ico saying it was important for the company to come out with live code early to prove the project was realbut what\\'s perhaps most striking about the sale was the choice of blockchainwhile latency or cost might not be a dealbreaker for some blockchain projects they are for mobius\\' use case its thesis is that traditional tech companies will soon want to integrate with cryptocurrencies and eventually a decentralized webmobius\\' white paper compares the company\\'s work to that of stripe the silicon valley darling that took integration of credit card payments down to a few lines of code (and incubated stellar in its early days) mobius aims to do the same thing for cryptocurrency payments and down the line for publishing data to trade on decentralized marketplacesso the company needed an iot-friendly network that could handle large amounts of transactions and data quickly with low or no feesthe goal is to \"make it easy to connect every device developer and data stream to the blockchain ecosystem\" gobaud saidyet while the vast majority of ico-funded projects have been run on top of ethereum using the erc-20 standard that blockchain has suffered from transaction backlogs and pendulum-like swings in feeshence after beginning its project on ethereum mobius switched to stellar the protocol created by ripple co-founder jed mccaleb like ripple before it stellar was designed specifically for frictionless paymentstrade-offsethereum\\'s scaling challenges have become acute in recent months the issue moved kik to announce that it would move its kin token off ethereum in december 2017while the ethereum developers recognize and are working on the problem the mobius team couldn\\'t wait for a scaling solution gobaud said\"we were building our dapp store on ethereum and then we connected with jed\" he said adding\"we realized there was no way that ethereum could handle our technology it was too slow too expensive and too insecure  we see all these other projects with these immense problems\"gobaud highlighted the problems with safely deploying smart contracts \"they are turing complete programs but they are really hard to write\" he said pointing to the first and second multi-million-dollar ether losses on parity solidity was not a language built with security in mind gobaud arguedin stellar \"we think we\\'ve uncovered this underutilized really unknown technology\" gobaud saidfor example stellar supports multi-signature wallets at the protocol level making custodianship much easier for developersbut stellar has its downsides gobaud acknowledged it\\'s not turing complete for example but mobius is happy to make that trade-off in exchange for vastly faster and cheaper transactionswhat\\'s nextthe white paper discusses a lot of use cases for the mobi token and its protocol but the easiest one to explain is paymentsfor anyone who believes that cryptocurrency will become more and more appealing to online businesses the company that makes transacting in crypto easy the fastest stands to recoup benefits with a long tailif mobius can make accepting crypto payments a matter of adding a few lines of code that would be compelling if online companies begin accepting cryptocurrency more widelytalking to gobaud though payments seems more like a way to sell the traditional internet on blockchain integrationhe\\'s most excited about the market that will come when firms start posting their data to decentralized marketplaces selling it via secure live auctions he calls the \"nasdaq for data\"gobaud said\"more advanced or technical users are really excited about the data marketplace because they are aware that getting data into blockchain ecosystem is really complicated\"data generated on blockchain protocols is easy to verify because they are closed environments but data from the real world can\\'t be verified on a blockchain without helpthat\\'s why mobius is building a proof-of-stake oracle system so that data streams with data from the real world can build up reputations as reliable sources over time with the system to put its data up for sale on the market a company would have to prove it holds a certain amount of tokensif that marketplace catches on the cost of staking should be more than paid for by revenue from selling data over time this could be anything from data about road conditions from a smart vehicle or local weather from a sensor on top of a commercial buildingto reach the point where the decentralized web has a rich enough ecosystem to support these marketplaces the team is also working to solve other small problems faced by developers on the way there for example it built a universal login protocol where a website can verify that a device holds a token to let its user log on to a servicesome sites might want to take this a step further and use tokens to integrate the level of access someone has to a site so on a platform like reddit a user might only need one token while a moderator might need a few tokens to log in with more advanced permissionsin the meantime developers are already building dapps for mobius\\' store but it\\'s small scale offerings so far little video games or prediction games that\\'s work at the experimental level but gobaud said he\\'s encouraged by the fact that people already want to work with it the websites on geocities were crude too but they were a stepping stone to the web we know todayhe concluded\"it\\'s like the early days of the internet\"disclosure coindesk is a subsidiary of

instead of ethereum the most popular blockchain for token salesthe comment underscores the growing interest in some corners of the crypto community for faster and cheaper payment rails as ethereum like bitcoin struggles to scalemobius announced thursday that it has raised $39 million in the ico \\x97 one of the larger recent token sales and the largest by far on the stellar platform the company accepted only stellar\\'s native currency lumens (xlm) in exchange for its own token known as mobi according to mobius the sale hit its $39 million hard cap after only two hours selling 35 percent of the total 888 million mobi tokensparticipants in the round included china\\'s angel chain capital nirvana capital and waltonchain an internet of things (iot) startup that is building devices to enable manufacturers and retailers to track supply chains according to the firm\\'s websitein addition to this backing gobaud emphasized that mobius deployed its decentralized app (dapp) store alongside its ico saying it was important for the company to come out with live code early to prove the project was realbut what\\'s perhaps most striking about the sale was the choice of blockchainwhile latency or cost might not be a dealbreaker for some blockchain projects they are for mobius\\' use case its thesis is that traditional tech companies will soon want to integrate with cryptocurrencies and eventually a decentralized webmobius\\' white paper compares the company\\'s work to that of stripe the silicon valley darling that took integration of credit card payments down to a few lines of code (and incubated stellar in its early days) mobius aims to do the same thing for cryptocurrency payments and down the line for publishing data to trade on decentralized marketplacesso the company needed an iot-friendly network that could handle large amounts of transactions and data quickly with low or no feesthe goal is to \"make it easy to connect every device developer and data stream to the blockchain ecosystem\" gobaud saidyet while the vast majority of ico-funded projects have been run on top of ethereum using the erc-20 standard that blockchain has suffered from transaction backlogs and pendulum-like swings in feeshence after beginning its project on ethereum mobius switched to stellar the protocol created by ripple co-founder jed mccaleb like ripple before it stellar was designed specifically for frictionless paymentstrade-offsethereum\\'s scaling challenges have become acute in recent months the issue moved kik to announce that it would move its kin token off ethereum in december 2017while the ethereum developers recognize and are working on the problem the mobius team couldn\\'t wait for a scaling solution gobaud said\"we were building our dapp store on ethereum and then we connected with jed\" he said adding\"we realized there was no way that ethereum could handle our technology it was too slow too expensive and too insecure  we see all these other projects with these immense problems\"gobaud highlighted the problems with safely deploying smart contracts \"they are turing complete programs but they are really hard to write\" he said pointing to the first and second multi-million-dollar ether losses on parity solidity was not a language built with security in mind gobaud arguedin stellar \"we think we\\'ve uncovered this underutilized really unknown technology\" gobaud saidfor example stellar supports multi-signature wallets at the protocol level making custodianship much easier for developersbut stellar has its downsides gobaud acknowledged it\\'s not turing complete for example but mobius is happy to make that trade-off in exchange for vastly faster and cheaper transactionswhat\\'s nextthe white paper discusses a lot of use cases for the mobi token and its protocol but the easiest one to explain is paymentsfor anyone who believes that cryptocurrency will become more and more appealing to online businesses the company that makes transacting in crypto easy the fastest stands to recoup benefits with a long tailif mobius can make accepting crypto payments a matter of adding a few lines of code that would be compelling if online companies begin accepting cryptocurrency more widelytalking to gobaud though payments seems more like a way to sell the traditional internet on blockchain integrationhe\\'s most excited about the market that will come when firms start posting their data to decentralized marketplaces selling it via secure live auctions he calls the \"nasdaq for data\"gobaud said\"more advanced or technical users are really excited about the data marketplace because they are aware that getting data into blockchain ecosystem is really complicated\"data generated on blockchain protocols is easy to verify because they are closed environments but data from the real world can\\'t be verified on a blockchain without helpthat\\'s why mobius is building a proof-of-stake oracle system so that data streams with data from the real world can build up reputations as reliable sources over time with the system to put its data up for sale on the market a company would have to prove it holds a certain amount of tokensif that marketplace catches on the cost of staking should be more than paid for by revenue from selling data over time this could be anything from data about road conditions from a smart vehicle or local weather from a sensor on top of a commercial buildingto reach the point where the decentralized web has a rich enough ecosystem to support these marketplaces the team is also working to solve other small problems faced by developers on the way there for example it built a universal login protocol where a website can verify that a device holds a token to let its user log on to a servicesome sites might want to take this a step further and use tokens to integrate the level of access someone has to a site so on a platform like reddit a user might only need one token while a moderator might need a few tokens to log in with more advanced permissionsin the meantime developers are already building dapps for mobius\\' store but it\\'s small scale offerings so far little video games or prediction games that\\'s work at the experimental level but gobaud said he\\'s encouraged by the fact that people already want to work with it the websites on geocities were crude too but they were a stepping stone to the web we know todayhe concluded\"it\\'s like the early days of the internet\"disclosure coindesk is a subsidiary of digital currency group which has an ownership

recently disclosed specter and meltdown processor vulnerabilities which showed how threats can linger for years undetected though as much as such giant engineering failures get attention each of us is more likely to be hit by smaller threats such as an email trick or an attachment loaded with malicious linksbut for swarm technologies there is a lack of incentives for security experts to look as widely as they couldspinning out of the security firm narf industries which recently completed a blockchain identity management project for the us department of homeland security swarm technologies believes a crypto token could be a way to close gaps in software more quickly as such on sunday night the company announced that it will be running an initial coin offering (ico) for the purpose of enlisting security researchers across the globe in creating a safer internet proceeds raised during the $50 million token sale which starts february 6 will initially go to building out a platform called polyswarm the hub where swarm hopes security researchers will come together to work on what it calls \"micro-engines\" specialized software built to scan documents files and websites that might hide vulnerabilitiesit\\'s becoming a common application of blockchains this use of a limited data set to galvanize distributed communities toward goals according to bassi augur the ethereum prediction market was of particular inspiration but while augur harnesses the wisdom of the crowd to predict outcomes polyswarm wants only to incentivize expertsbut to understand the company\\'s mission it\\'s helpful to understand how threat detection works today where enterprise companies do scans to check for threats when web users do anything from click on a url to open an emailto do this more effectively swarm is looking to enlist enterprise it teams and antivirus software companies that spot new files new software new documents that need to be scanned to farm out those scans to a distributed network of researchers those researchers will build machines to do specific scans and each time they do swarm will reward the machines by sending them the tokenand in bassi\\'s mind this use case will flip cryptocurrency’s role as it relates to security – from paying the ransom on encryption attacks to one that makes developing solutions for more niche areas of the internet viablebassi told coindesk\"we’re basically trying to re-invent threat intelligence\"security nectarthreat intelligence with added economics is another way to put itswarm\\'s token or \"nectar\" will have a finite supply 70 percent of which will be sold during the ico the company itself will keep 15 percent of the tokens and the other 15 percent will be used to grow the network including strategic allocations to potential security industry partnersthe company is capping the sale at $50 million with a $5 million pre-sale down the road swarm envisions new business lines in assurance services such as verification of security experts analysis and insuranceas an erc-20 token riding on the ethereum blockchain bassi said smart contracts are at the core of what will make the offering succeed the nectar tokens will be used to make all the payments on the platform but those payments don\\'t just flow from swarm to the researchers the system also requires micro-engines to stake an amount of nectar tokens on its assessment of the digital products it\\'s scanning\"the tokens they have to put into their assertion also indicates their confidence in that assertion\" bassi told coindeskevery micro-engine (and in turn the researcher who built it) that makes the correct assessment gets a share of the fee paid for the scan plus a share of any nectar that was staked by micro-engines that assessed the digital product incorrectlyand according to bassi this mechanism of shared rewards incentivizes researchers to find niche areas to scan where many other researchers might not be lookingthis is particularly novel in that today\\'s anti-virus company structures incentivize chasing threats against the most widely used software in an effort to attract the largest possible client basehe told coindesk\"it provides more incentives to cover the minority populations that are getting hit hard with this stuff\"and yet swarm isn\\'t out to totally disrupt the incumbents such as norton and mcafee in the space instead bassi said those companies could serve as what polyswarm calls \"ambassadors\" actually managing the relationship with consumers while polyswarm enables them to guard against more threat surfaceblockchain criticsyet for some adding a blockchain to this industry isn\\'t going to solve the problemsaccording to jessy irwin a security consultant and an alum of agilebits the developer of one of the leading password managers 1password \"i don\\'t see a clear or realistic incentive to adding a blockchain to this particular problem\"irwin continued arguing that threat intelligence is already distributed and collaborative\"malware hunters and researchers are very much widely distributed in many different kinds of organizations\" she said \"the people working on these issues are highly collaborative with one another while they are working on specific projects and campaigns\"yet while irwin is skeptical other well-known security researchers seem to see value in the platform swarm\\'s advisers on the project include dan guido ceo of trail of bits a security firm that’s a member of the enterprise ethereum alliance and mark tonnesen whose done executive stints at cisco and mcafeeaccording to bassi \"a token is critical to that because up until a few years ago we didn’t have a way to move rewards across borders in sub-cent amounts without involving the global banking infrastructure\"as guido told coindesk \"they\\'re security engineers who found a new way to solve an old problem with blockchain technology if another tool fit they job then that\\'s what they would be using\"but bassi\\'s convinced that smart contracts are the right tool to get more eyes on threats\"it encourages the use of a utility token for a service that’s deeply needed\"safety deposit boxes via shutterstock\\nthe leader in blockchain news coindesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict

decentralized blockchain protocols and distributed projectsthe following article is an exclusive contribution to coindesk\\'s 2017 in reviewif 2017 is to be remembered as a time when cryptographic tokens enabled novel distributed network concepts and significant capital was raised 2018 will bring more maturity in crypto-economic systems and decentralized applicationswith that in mind i have been calling summer 2017 the \"summer of crypto love\" here in san francisco it was the 50th anniversary of the \"summer of love\" – a magical unique moment where artists and intellectuals came together to explore new ways of thinking but this summer which was just as astounding was defined by everyone\\'s love for cryptothe scope of the impact that blockchain technologies will have in reorganizing capital and intelligence (both human and machine) was recognized by business leaders all over the world we saw extreme excitement for tokenized projects which drove high valuations in token crowdfunds (icos)clearly there were examples of overvaluation in some assets but discounting the ico model as merely a bubble or temporary hysteria would miss the forest for the treeswhen a token is designed correctly and distributed thoughtfully to drive network effects the leverage that a project can get from a massive globally distributed investor base is remarkable crowdfund participants contribute significant technical resources evangelize and market the project and generally add value that is very difficult for even a very talented venture capitalist to matchcapital is no longer a scarce resource because private vcs are no longer the gatekeepers of capital so investors are being forced to actually deliver value-add for projects beyond writing a chequei see this trend as generally positive and the natural evolution of the early-stage funding modeltuning up\\nbut while the world was getting hyped on icos here at the polychain office we were spending most of our time \"jamming\" on crypto-economic models with our portfolio entrepreneurs the results have been very compelling\\nin case you are unclear on the meaning of cryptoeconomics it is the emerging field of study of how we use digital incentives to drive specific resources and behaviors on decentralized networks that lead to some globally desired result such as security or network effects\\ni call the brainstorming process of designing the right cryptoeconomic model \"jamming\" as a tip-of-the-hat to the music creation process i observe that very few technologists possess the entire suite of competencies necessary to build a great crypto-economic model alone it requires expertise in game theory computer science behavioural psychology various fields of economics math logic distributed computing security and a deep understanding of blockchain technologies and their limitations\\nso as in music the best results are achieved when a fantastic group comes together and each talented individual shares their respective skills in a complementary fashion while being open minded to improvisation\\n\\nanecdotally this term has been inspired by my friend the great musician and technologist simon de la rouviere who is great to jam with either on music or on crypto-economics\\nthe following are some observations that have came from the many jam sessions of this year\\nthe block reward is returning\\nwe are starting to see more projects plan to sell only a minority of their tokens to fund project development and instead intend to distribute their token over time to coherently incentivize an array network participants\\nan elegantly designed block reward scheme (ideally adjusted periodically via a governance model) that incentivizes the different key players – keepers (ie miners validators etc) core protocol devs application devs and the wider ecosystem participants is an incredibly powerful concept and will be important as the battle for developer mindshare intensifies moving forward\\nin part juan benet and his team at protocol labs can be credited for the return of the block reward juan decided to sell only 10 percent of his network in his high-profile saft round in august and instead prioritized the block reward with 70 percent of the filecoin allocation\\ni predict this prudent design will drive an amazing amount of professionally operated storage providers to the ipfs network pushing the cost for retail users to store their files on ipfs to nearly zero\\nwe remain in the \\'infrastructure era\\' … for now\\nthere is a thoughtful debate around protocol layer vs application layer as an investment thesis and we recognize that there is considerable grey area in the classification of projects within the taxonomy of our ecosystem\\nhowever i observe that outlier value will continue to accrue deeper down the decentralized software stack known as web3 we still have a long way to go to have adequate infrastructure for web3 that will subsequently provide a platform for consumer applications at scale we still require multiple orders of magnitude improvement on scalability para-chain deployment more robust developer tools and applications that make interacting with blockchain technologies far less cumbersome for non-technical users\\nyet this industry moves faster than any other on the planet and i’m confident that we will see the emergence of the ‘application era’ far sooner than we would guess today\\nat the core of our thesis polychain remains laser focused on investing in and supporting the infrastructure layer of web3 and there are two implications for the year ahead that we draw from this thesis – the emergence of major ecosystems & meta protocols\\nmajor ecosystems are maturing\\nethereum was the first \"major ecosystem\" to emerge beyond bitcoin and present a rich topography for open source developers to create decentralized applications and higher-layer protocols\\nentering 2018 we are seeing the emergence of other major ecosystems that have aggregated lessons learned and present considerable performance improvements above what is available today these new major ecosystems will spawn their own communities of developers entrepreneurs researchers investors users evangelists and so on\\npolkadot dfinity tezos and filecoin are all positioned to trigger a cambrian explosion of innovation and novel applications across the space\\ni\\'m incredibly excited to watch this story unfold in 2018 as all four of these major ecosystems will go live and begin to capture developer mindshare and notoriety and some will become crucial components of the decentralized web\\nmeta-protocols are coming\\none of the many amazing contributions to crypto-economics that my brilliant partner and the founder of polychain capital olaf carlson-wee has made during our jam sessions is the idea of the \"meta-protocol\"\\nthis is a protocol that is applicable to many different underlying blockchains and actual generates further security and network effects by supporting different ecosystems simultaneously a great example of a meta-protocol is 1protocol which will be a relevant tool for staking across the space\\nother examples of meta-protocols are truebit for off-chain computational verification nucypher for proxy re-encryption and keep for private data management on-chain\\ni offer a few other predictions for the year ahead\\n\\ngovernance and daos – the next year will bring some high profile experiments with on-chain governance and we are excited to observe the results the launch of dfinity and tezos will be the largest attempts to fully deploy on-chain governance i am cautiously optimistic that we will also see the re-emergence of prominent daos in 2018 including daos that govern development of an underlying blockchain\\nfunctioning applications – we are also on the cusp of seeing some really compelling applications within the ethereum community personally i am very proud of the makerdao project that launched the dai stable coin this month this is one of the oldest projects in the ethereum community and is led by a very talented technical team instead of getting distracted with a flashy ico the makerdao team focused on building their project and the result is one of the first dapps that is robust and ready to scale\\nstablecoins – are critical to the larger crypto ecosystem so that businesses and smart contract systems can perform transactions on-chain without speculating on the underlying currency functional dapps will drive a new cohort of users to the space and accelerate the speed of mass  adoption\\n\\na bigger picture is forming\\nthrough the emergence of crypto-economics i believe the study of economics will forward more in the next 24 months then has occurred in the last 24 years\\nwhile there are so many reasons for gratitude as we conclude this remarkable 2017 what i am most grateful for is to be able to come into the polychain office every day to join a wicked-smart team that is constantly challenging my assumptions and theories on cryptoeconomics as we chart new territory\\ni am incredibly lucky and deeply humbled to work closely with the top technical teams in the space who come from all over the world to jam on their crypto-economic models and share lessons

country that is at the center of its support there used to be a concern about the longevity of bitcoin the safety of using such a novel new invention2017 is the year that fear died – and japan is a big part of that reasonwhere other countries have had knee-jerk responses to bitcoin and blockchain technology japan\\'s financial services agency (fsa) expertly analyzed the technology and developed clear and fair laws to regulate virtual currency exchanges this is no small matter – bitcoin exchanges are the onboard ramp to both bitcoin adoption as well as the future of virtual currenciescoming

japanese satoshi nakamoto is a japanese name japan is bitcoin\\'s homebut though bitcoin has always had strong roots in japan it was also the center of its biggest controversysome say that mt gox\\'s implosion now nearly four years removed was the worst event to ever happen to bitcoin the numbers were staggering 650000 bitcoins worth around $437 million at the time were lost when the exchange abruptly closed the company filed for bankruptcy this affected over 127000 customers around the world today those lost bitcoins are worth nearly $9 billionstill this event while terrible forced the japanese regulators to step in and protect consumersthat disruption that explosion is why japan has become the most forward thinking jurisdiction for bitcoin and virtual currencies the fsa\\'s understanding of the technology regardless of the bad or inexperienced actors early in the space helped lay the foundation on which the rest of the world can begin to understand and fully accept bitcoin and other virtual currenciesstarting on april 1 of this year the japanese government enacted an amendment to the payment services act these amendments which bitflyer helped establish have been referred to as the virtual currency act and alongside additional tax reform have provided three main pieces of regulation in 20171 legal clarification of bitcointhe virtual currency act described and identified what a virtual currency is clarified that bitcoin is considered an asset and that bitcoin can be considered a payment methodthat act however did not declare bitcoin as a legal currency as some have mistakenly professed2 virtual currency exchange regulationthe japan financial services authority was granted the ability to both regulate as well as issue licenses to virtual currency exchanges in japan this cemented bitcoin as an established market in japan where the rules are clear and consumers can be protectedbitflyer was proud to be granted one of the first licenses of this sort earlier this year in september3 one additional piece of regulation from a different actlastly while not part of the virtual currency act tax reform was pushed forward on july 1 which removed a consumption tax that dissuaded foreign investors from purchasing bitcoins on japan\\'s market this opened up japan’s markets to international investorsexpanding bitcoin and blockchain usagebut while japan has led the way the rest of the world should learn from the regulations and research that has resultedhere bitflyer has been able to work closely with government organizations to provide research and information about the usability of bitcoin and blockchain technology the research just like bitcoin is borderless and publicly available bitflyer has also been hard at work researching and developing a world-class enterprise blockchain called \"miyabi\" with a top speed of over 4000 transactions per second miyabi guarantees immutability finality byzantine fault tolerance low latency and has no single point of failurethis work has not gone unnoticedthe largest interbank clearing network in japan has selected bitflyer to demonstrate a proof of concept utilizing miyabi to show how blockchain can be used to revolutionize the banking industry and create a much faster settlement platform if adopted the largest banks in japan will be connected through blockchain and demonstrate to the world that enterprise blockchain can be implemented securely creating a better and more united financial worldthese developments are why we believe 2018 will be another spectacular year for

placed 3461 matches occurred and trading volume reached $155 millioncontinued liquidity problems meant the relaunch of bch/eur and bch/btc books to be postponed until after the winter holidays \"when

capital partners llc an investment manager focused on investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain assetsthe crypto market moves in cycles – and understanding these cycles is key to profiting managing risk and keeping sanehoward marks describes two ways to profit from markets (1) hold more of the things that rise and less of the things that fall and (2) cycle adjustment or trying to have more risk exposure when markets rise and less when they fallmost people ignore the second part yet the key to cycle adjustment is understanding where you are in the cycle and calibrating the risks and rewards to account for it similar to the broader economy we have both short and long-term cycles short-term cycles are driven by the capital flows investor composition and market sentiment long-term cycles result from the aggregate effects of the short-term cycles and ultimately are driven by long-term fundamentalsthe past few months in contextover the last few months the market has been driven by new

btc\\'s price increased from $2492 to almost $20000i\\'ll stress that this was not driven by fundamentals but rather the capital flows and accessibility premium of bitcoin new capital had a bias for

more and more dominated by retail and – let\\'s be honest – less crypto-educated capital coinbase is a great proxy for this phenomenon from june to october coinbase signups were relatively constant at  about30000 per dayhowever starting in early november this number started to increase dramatically exceeding 100000 on some daysinitially this capital continued to pour into bitcoin putting fuel on the short-term cycle and building new investor sentiment in favor of btcbtc was going to $100000 and by the time cnbc debuted its coveted \"btc ticker\" the pendulum had swung too far in btc\\'s directionlarger investors started to take profits bitcoin began to falter it was time to find the next new shiny object…as capital moved out of bitcoin and into other assets we saw the end of one short-term cycle and beginning of the next starting in early december a new cycle began and the \"cheaper\" coinbase assets stole the showcapital that initially entered the crypto markets through btc was finally comfortable with the crypto space and willing to move out on the risk curve in other words it was time to play with house moneythe newer retail entrants cared less about fundamental protocol strength and were easily lured into a protocol\\'s marketing pitch these were not cypherpunksbtc is archaic and overpriced to these investors there is no eea of bitcoin no marketing team is
